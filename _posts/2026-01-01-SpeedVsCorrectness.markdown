In the fast-paced world of technology and business, leaders often face a paralyzed dilemma: the tension between **speed** (making a decision quickly) and **correctness** (making the *perfect* decision).

We are conditioned to believe that accuracy is paramount. In school, we are graded on getting the right answer. In engineering, a single bug can bring down a system. However, in leadership and strategy, the equation changes. 

The pursuit of absolute certainty often incurs a hidden cost—the **tax of delayed decisions**. This tax is paid in missed market opportunities, stalled momentum, and team frustration.

## The Illusion of Perfection

Many leaders fall into the trap of "Analysis Paralysis." They wait for 100% of the data before making a move, believing that more information guarantees a better outcome. 

While valid for high-stakes, irreversible choices, this mindset is fatal for the majority of day-to-day decisions. By the time you have perfect information, the opportunity has often passed, or the market context has shifted.

> "If you wait for 90% of the information, you’re probably being too slow."

## Type 1 vs. Type 2 Decisions

To navigate this trade-off, it is helpful to adopt the mental model popularized by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos regarding decision types:

1.  **Type 1 Decisions (One-way doors):** These are consequential and irreversible. Once you walk through, there is no going back. These decisions require deep deliberation, extensive data, and caution. Speed is *not* the priority here.
    *   *Example:* Selling the company, a major architectural pivot, exiting a market.

2.  **Type 2 Decisions (Two-way doors):** These are changeable and reversible. If you make a sub-optimal choice, you can reopen the door and go back. These should be made quickly by high-judgment individuals or small groups.
    *   *Example:* Trying a new marketing channel, launching a feature experiment, internal process changes.

The organizational failure occurs when we treat **Type 2** decisions as if they are **Type 1**, applying heavy-weight processes to lightweight problems.

## The Cost of Waiting vs. The Cost of Being Wrong

When we prioritize correctness over speed, we ignore the value of the **feedback loop**.

*   **Fast Decision:** You decide, you execute, you learn. If you are wrong, you pivot quickly. You have gained valuable data from the real world.
*   **Slow Decision:** You debate, you analyze, you delay. You have zero real-world data, only hypotheses.

### Comparison: The two approaches

| **Dimension** | **Optimizing for Correctness** | **Optimizing for Speed** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Risk avoidance and certainty. | Learning and momentum. |
| **Data Required** | ~90-100% of information. | ~70% of information. |
| **Failure Mode** | "Too little, too late." Stagnation. | "Fail fast." Course correction required. |
| **Team Impact** | Frustration, bureaucracy, disempowerment. | Energy, autonomy, rapid iteration. |
| **Best Used For** | Irreversible (Type 1) decisions. | Reversible (Type 2) decisions. |

## How to Cultivate a "Bias for Action"

To reduce the invisible tax of delayed decisions, leaders must actively cultivate a culture of speed:

1.  **The 70% Rule:** Don't wait for perfect data. If you have 70% of the information you need, go. The remaining 30% is usually discovered during execution.
2.  **Disagree and Commit:** Consensus is a speed-killer. Allow robust debate, but once a decision is made, everyone must commit to the execution, even if they disagreed with the choice.
3.  **Delegate Authority:** Push decision-making down to the people closest to the problem. They often have better context and can move faster than a centralized committee.
4.  **Celebrate Correction:** Remove the stigma of being "wrong" if the correction happens quickly. value the *agility* to fix mistakes over the *pride* of never making them.

## Summary

Speed is not about recklessness; it is about recognizing that **time is a non-renewable resource**.

In a landscape defined by volatility and change, the organization that learns the fastest wins. And you cannot learn if you are standing still, waiting for the perfect answer.

*Are you paying the invisible tax of delayed decisions?*
