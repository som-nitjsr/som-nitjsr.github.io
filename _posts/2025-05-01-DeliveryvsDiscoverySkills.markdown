## **Summary:**
Delivery skills focus on efficient execution of existing business models.

Discovery skills focus on exploration and creation of new business models.

Organizations fail to innovate mainly because they over-invest in delivery and under-invest in discovery, becoming too focused on today’s success and blind to tomorrow’s opportunities.

## Delivery Skills vs Discovery Skills

| **Aspect**              | **Delivery Skills**                                | **Discovery Skills**                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**                | Execute, optimize, scale existing offerings       | Explore, invent, validate new opportunities       |
| **Focus**               | Efficiency, predictability, quality control       | Experimentation, creativity, adaptability         |
| **Mindset**             | "Do it right."                                    | "Find the right thing to do."                     |
| **Core Activities**     | Project execution, process optimization, cost management | Ideation, prototyping, customer insights gathering |
| **Organizational Value**| Sustains current revenue and profitability         | Secures future growth and competitive edge        |
| **Key Roles**           | Operations, project managers, finance, engineering teams | R&D, innovation labs, product strategists, intrapreneurs |

## Why Organizations Fail to Innovate

| **Root Cause**               | **Explanation**                                                                 | **Impact**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Delivery-Driven Culture**  | Organizations reward operational excellence (KPIs, targets), not exploration.   | Discovery skills atrophy, ideas are stifled early.                        |
| **Short-Termism**            | Pressure for quarterly results discourages risk-taking and long-term bets.      | Innovation projects are underfunded or abandoned.                         |
| **Fear of Cannibalization**  | Leaders fear that new innovations will undermine existing profitable products.  | Missed opportunities (e.g., Kodak with digital cameras).                  |
| **Lack of Structures for Discovery** | Innovation initiatives are trapped inside traditional hierarchical structures. | Discovery requires autonomy and faster cycles, which delivery-focused orgs resist. |
| **Risk Aversion and Cultural Inertia** | Organizations become too comfortable with "what works."                     | They fail to respond to disruptive changes from competitors or market shifts. |
| **Misaligned Talent Strategy** | Hiring favors operators and executors over explorers and innovators.            | Teams lack the cognitive diversity needed for breakthrough thinking.       |

## Practical Challenges
I believe that in any organization, innovation must be driven from the top, not from the bottom up. Too often, I see leaders primarily focused on cost and timelines. Rarely do I hear a leader say, 'Don't worry about the cost or deadlines—I'm here to support your efforts to innovate and explore new possibilities.

## How the Gap Worsens Over Time

## Strategic Insight:
Successful innovators master the "ambidexterity" of managing delivery and discovery together.

### Corporate examples:

Amazon invests heavily in delivery (supply chain) and discovery (AWS, Alexa, Project Kuiper).

Apple relentlessly executes delivery (iPhone upgrades) while pioneering discovery (Wearables, AR/VR).
