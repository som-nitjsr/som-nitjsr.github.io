I used to see success as optimizing architectures, delivering stable cloud environments, and solving complex technical problems.
But during my Executive MBA at **IIM Ahmedabad**, that perspective changed.

I started thinking less like a *technical leader*—and more like a *CTO*.

Here’s what that shift looked like:

---

🔹 **1. From Cost Optimization to Value Creation**

Before: “We saved 20% on cloud spend.”
Now: “How does this contribute to revenue growth, strategic advantage, or customer stickiness?”

MBA thinking reframed every tech decision in terms of **business value**—not just efficiency.

---

🔹 **2. From Technical Alignment to Business Impact**

My role expanded from aligning with dev and ops…
To aligning with **GTM, risk, compliance, and CXO vision**.

> Great CTOs don’t just align tech. They **align influence** across functions.

---

🔹 **3. From Execution to Strategic Timing**

I used to focus on *how* to build.
Now I ask:

> “Why now? Why us? What if we don’t?”

This lens creates **urgency, clarity**, and the space to say *no* to things that don’t move the business forward.

---

🔹 **4. From Projects to Platforms**

I moved from building discrete projects…
To enabling **platforms** that:

* Scale across business units
* Power data-driven decisions
* Enable ecosystems and external integrations

CTOs think in **flywheels**, not one-off deliveries.

---

🔹 **5. From Technical Authority to Strategic Influence**

CTOs aren’t the smartest person in the room—they’re the best at uniting smart people behind a shared vision.

MBA training sharpened my skills in:

* Executive storytelling
* Financial framing
* Navigating stakeholder politics

Because at the executive level:

> **Influence matters more than control.**

---

🚀 **My takeaway:**

The MBA didn’t just teach me finance or strategy.
It taught me to lead *with* technology—but not *through* technology alone.

If you're a technical leader aiming for executive roles, invest in learning how **business thinks**.
You’ll not only ship better solutions—you’ll **shape the future of the company.**
