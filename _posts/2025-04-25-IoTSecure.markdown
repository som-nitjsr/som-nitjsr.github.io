Secure Boot is a hardware-rooted security mechanism that ensures a device boots using only trusted firmware and software.

It prevents:

Malware or unauthorized code from executing during boot.

Rollback attacks by verifying firmware version integrity.

🧠 Secure Boot Architecture in a Chipset
1. Root of Trust (RoT)
Definition: Immutable code stored in ROM (Read-Only Memory) inside the chipset.

Purpose: Verifies the authenticity of the next boot stage.

Implemented As:

Hardcoded bootloader hash or public key

ROM-based signature validation logic

2. Boot ROM
The first code executed on power-on.

Performs cryptographic validation (typically RSA/ECDSA) of:

The first-stage bootloader

Using digital signatures and a public key embedded in ROM

3. Chain of Trust
Each boot stage cryptographically verifies the next:

Edit
Boot ROM → 1st Stage Bootloader → 2nd Stage Bootloader → OS Kernel → Trusted App/OS
If any step fails verification:

Boot halts

Optionally enters recovery mode

4. Cryptographic Elements
Asymmetric crypto (RSA, ECDSA): for verifying signatures

Symmetric crypto (AES, HMAC): for encrypting or authenticating firmware

Hashing (SHA-256/512): to ensure data integrity

5. Anti-Rollback Protection
Uses a monotonic counter or version fuse (eFuses or OTP memory)

Prevents firmware downgrade attacks

6. Key Storage
Public key: burned into ROM or eFuses

Private key: securely held by the firmware signing authority (not on-chip)

7. Firmware Update Support
Only signed updates are accepted

Version check prevents downgrading

Some platforms support encrypted firmware as well

🔧 Example in Practice
For an IoT SoC (e.g., NXP, STMicro, Qualcomm):
Boot ROM is fixed in silicon.

Secure Key Storage in eFuses or OTP memory.

Bootloader uses X.509 certificates for chain-of-trust.

Anti-rollback via version field in firmware and fuse-based version checks.

✅ Benefits
Ensures system starts in a known-good state

Protects against bootloader or firmware tampering

Forms the foundation for Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and Secure Firmware Updates

⚠️ Challenges
Complex key management

Device bricking if Secure Boot keys or policies are misconfigured

Performance overhead during boot (mitigated with hardware acceleration)
